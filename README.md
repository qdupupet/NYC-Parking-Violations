# NYC-Parking-Violations

This project serves as practice in SQL and visualization on a dataset includes over 40 million parking violations in New York City with 51 features. 

Commented out of the notebook at the top is my code for concatenating all of the data into a single dataframe and tranforming that into a SQLite database in chunks. The data can be found on Kaggle here: 
    https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/nyc-parking-tickets/data

My process thus far will be to pose questions of increasing complexity and answer them with a combination of SQL queries, pandas, and seaborn/matplotlib.
